# Simple Packet Sniffer

This is a simple packet sniffer implemented in Python that captures and analyzes network packets. The tool uses the `scapy` library to monitor network traffic and display relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.

> **Important**: This project is intended for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have explicit permission to capture network traffic on any network you are monitoring, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Features

- Captures and logs network packets in real-time.
- Displays source and destination IP addresses.
- Identifies protocols (TCP, UDP) used in the packets.
- Shows payload data for captured packets.

## Requirements

### Software

- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library

### Hardware

- A network interface card (NIC) that supports promiscuous mode.
- Sufficient system resources (RAM and CPU) for processing packets.

### Knowledge

- Basic Python programming skills.
- Understanding of networking fundamentals (IP addressing, TCP/IP model, common protocols).
- Awareness of ethical considerations in packet sniffing.

## Installation
